<p>Much to the dismay of my dearly beloved wife, I have been hooked on&nbsp;<em>Breaking Bad&nbsp;</em>since the first episode. Throughout the run of the show, she and I have butt heads on more than one occasion about whether or not it's permissible to watch it, as a Christian.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: Coming up in the next few paragraphs is a short rant about how I consume content.</p>
<p>I think part of the reason that we disagree so much on the show (aside from the fact that we generally have different tastes in TV and movies) is that we approach it in entirely different mindsets. It may very well be the literature class I took from one <a href="http://www.proflay.com">distinguished college professor</a>&nbsp;creeping up in the real world, but I'm much more analytic and critical about what I watch than Brandy. She tends to approach TV, movies, music, etc. as a means of entertainment/enjoyment. When I tried to discuss the literary merits and pitfalls of the most recent film adaptation of&nbsp;<em>The Great Gatsby</em>, I was met with immediate resistance. She assumes that because I have criticisms of it (right alongside praises), I must have hated the movie. Much to the contrary, I thought it was an awesome movie. However, I genuinely enjoy deconstructing books, TV shows, movies, etc.</p>
<p>Frankly, I think that watching anything purely as a consumer is a dangerous way to live. There are so many different means of consuming content in our society. Whether you watch it on TV, in the movie theater, listen to the soundtrack, read it in a book, or read it in a magazine this content surrounds us each and every day. If we just consume this content for the sake of entertainment, there is no way that we could appropriately process everything as it comes in.</p>
<p>That way of living lends itself to making a habit out of watching, reading, and listening to "Christian things." We try to block out all the bad stuff and take in only the good stuff, and rightly so. Because we all know that a <a href="http://go.voris.me/306jl">little bit of poop spoils the whole batch of brownies</a>. By simply blocking out any piece of content that doesn't align with our morals (at least, our morals <em>today</em>), we miss out on a much larger discussion about society, ethics, and humanity as a whole. If we consume content, whether or not it's labeled "Christian," with an eye for analysis and an ear for discussion, then we place that content into it's larger cultural context and we can take the opportunity to critically examine that culture (along with our own lives) in light of the good and the bad.</p>
<p>OK, enough of that, onto the real reason I started writing...</p>
<p>Let me get this out of the way: I'm not going to argue, and I don't think anyone would in their right mind, that the content in&nbsp;<em>Breaking Bad</em> is morally upstanding. It's just about as far from "family-friendly" as you can get without watching a snuff film or flat-out pornagraphy (or some weird, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Clockwork_Orange_(film)">British combination</a>&nbsp;of the two). Let's agree on that fact, regardless of which side of the fence you're camped on. Regardless of that fact, we can actually gleen some insight into our own lives through a look at&nbsp;the show.</p>
<h2>The Characters Grow and Change</h2>
<p>I like the show because the characters change and show depth.</p>
<p>At the end of Friends,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Tribbiani">Joey Tribbiani</a>&nbsp;was still an out-of-work actor (minus one apartment). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_house">Dr. Gregory House</a>&nbsp;continually beats around the bush making his colleagues' lives miserable because he's already solved the riddle, only to step in at the last minute to save a patient's life. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_simpson">Bart Simpson</a>&nbsp;will do something next week to upset Principal Skinner, just like he did this (and last) week.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<em>Breaking Bad</em>,&nbsp;we see the evolution of Walter White (a mild-mannered chemist/doormat) into Heisenberg (a full-fledged methamphetamine kingpin with more than a couple murders under his belt). We see a loving wife transformed into an unfaithful, unapologetic adulteress into a money-laundering accomplice into a violent, revenge-fueled would-be-murderer into a broken shell of a woman who has been through Hell.</p>
<p>Every character in the show has changed drastically since their first appearance. As human beings, we change. It's a part of life. Every day we wake up a little different than we were when we went to bed. Whether or not you claim to be a Christian, you can't deny that change is an integral part of life. We grow, learn, and adapt to changing circumstances. I always find it fascinating to watch that change in the lives of others.</p>
<p>The transformations of these characters not only show incredible depth and growth, but they show a very unique (and, frankly, terrifying) view of the results of sin. Many of the characters change in response to sin (often, but not always, their own). The truth is that our sin has an impact on our lives and the lives of those around us.&nbsp;<em>Breaking Bad</em> takes that to an extreme level.</p>
<h2>Our Small Choices can Impact our Lives</h2>
<p>All that change these characters have exhibited is brought on by choices.</p>

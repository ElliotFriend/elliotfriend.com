<p>Let's get one thing straight: the death of Michael Brown is a tragedy. Regardless of whether you believe what the officials are saying, or if you believe the popular narrative, the tragedy is there. A young man is no longer with us. Life is sacred, and the loss of one, under any circumstance, should affect us. That fact deeply moves me, and I'm confident it will remain that way for quite some time.</p>
<p>Rather than argue about what&nbsp;did or did not take place, let's put that discussion aside for the moment. Once some of the dust settles, and some more facts are out in the open, I'm sure that we can continue to have that discourse.</p>
<p>For now, let's talk about what's currently happening in <strong><a class="vt-p" title="#Ferguson on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/hashtag/ferguson" target="_blank">#Ferguson</a></strong>. I just watched a video depicting a protest that took place tonight. It was a livestream that someone was recording of a protest. It took place on West Florissant Ave., and it was pretty difficult to watch. Amid all the confusion and misinformation that's floating around, I learned some things when I actually stopped compulsively refreshing my twitter feed, and just watched.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The protesters are not looting and they are not rioting</strong>. Sure, this particular video can't possibly represent every protest or every demonstration that has taken place in the past few days. However, in this case, it genuinely was a peaceful protest.I think after the first night of chaos, everyone assumed that this was going to be a perpetual state of rioting and looting. I'd have to admit that I was guilty of thinking that, myself. What I saw tonight was very peaceful on the part of the protesters.</li>
<li><strong>The demand is "Justice for Mike Brown."</strong>&nbsp;Before watching that video, I was very uncertain&nbsp;as to why any sort of protests were taking place. Tonight's protest helped me to see more clearly what the people are asking for.Again, putting aside the discussion of who's right and who's wrong, let's look at the demand. The protesters are asking that some real action is taking regarding the investigation of the shooting. From most of the politicians, news outlets, and St. Louis as a whole, those in Ferguson haven't gotten jack-crap! All they are asking for are some answers as to why this tragic event took place. They're met not with a conversation, but with hyper-militarized police.
<p>I'm a huge proponent of the First Amendment, and one of the foundations of our civil liberties in the United States is "the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances." This is what is happening in Ferguson right now. The people are petitioning for answers, in respect to this particular grievance.</li>
<li><strong>The police are going freakin' nuts!</strong>&nbsp;I just watched as the police (wearing riot gear, mind you) shot tear gas and rubber bullets into a crowd of unarmed protesters who were holding their hands up in a gesture of non-resistance.Police brutality sure has&nbsp;been on the rise, all across this country. It's only on rare occasions that you get a glimpse so close to home. In a situation like this, it doesn't make any sense to call in the cavalry restore order, when there's only disorder because of the cavalry to begin with.
<p>When was the last time that there were two groups of people fighting, emotions were running super-high, tensions were growing even higher, and giving one of the sides heavy artillery to use against their unarmed opponents made the situation completely resolve itself?</p>
<p>Yeah, never.</li>
<li><strong>The police are doing their jobs!</strong> I bet you thought I was all aboard the cop-hating bandwagon there. No way!The police have taken an enormous responsibility on their shoulders. They are charged with keeping our communities safe. Sometimes and some places they do that better than others. But, (most of the time) all they're trying to do is protect and serve.
<p>I'm tremendously grateful for all that the police officers are doing, as they try to keep St. Louis a safe place to live. Like we said earlier, this particular protest was peaceful. But, the police have no way of knowing when and if a protest will turn violent.</p>
<p>Can they keep the peace without calling 90% of the police officers from the surrounding jurisdictions to Ferguson? Probably.</p>
<p>Can they keep the peace without firing tear gas and rubber bullets and using LRADs to try and disperse a crowd? Certainly.</p>
<p>I'm confident that their motives are in the right place. Their methods raise an awful lot of questions, though. Then again, I'm sure the individual officers with boots on the ground are simply following orders.</li>
</ol>
<p>There's a lot of thoughts there that just puked themselves out of my fingers. So, if it doesn't make sense, tough.</p>

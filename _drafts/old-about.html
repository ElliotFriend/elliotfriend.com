<p>I&rsquo;m a Christian, husband/Father, technology enthusiast, preacher, teacher, student, creator, and the list could go on and on. I grew up in Phoenix, Arizona. I moved to Saint Louis to go to college in 2007, and have called it home since. I married the love of my life in 2010, and have loved every minute of being with her. We&rsquo;re expecting our first child, a little girl, around January 2012. In 2011, I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Preaching Ministry. I degree I&rsquo;m not currently putting to good use, but certainly hope to in the near future. For the time-being, I work at the college I graduated from as the IT Director. I love playing with all manner of technology, and my position at the college gives me a very unique chance to explore a lot of different avenues of technology.</p>

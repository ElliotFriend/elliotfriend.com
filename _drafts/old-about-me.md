<p>I'm a Christian, husband/father, technology enthusiast, preacher, teacher, student, creator, and the list could go on and on.</p>
<p>I grew up in Phoenix, Arizona. I moved to St.&nbsp;Louis to go to college in 2007, and have called it home since.</p>
<p>I married the love of my life in 2010, and have loved every minute of being with her. Our first child, Journey Sophia Voris, was born on 14 January 2012.</p>
<p>In 2011, I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Preaching Ministry: A degree I'm not currently putting to good use, but certainly plan&nbsp;to in the near future.</p>
<p>For the time-being, I work at <a class="vt-p" title="St. Louis Christian College" href="https://stlchristian.edu" target="_blank">St. Louis Christian College</a>&nbsp;as the IT Director. I love playing with all manner of technology, and my position at the college gives me a very unique chance to explore a lot of different avenues.</p>

<p>DID YOU SEE <a class="vt-p" href="http://go.voris.me/ur4c5" target="_blank">IT</a>!!?! Seriously, <a class="vt-p" href="http://go.voris.me/ur4c5" target="_blank">click here</a>!! Did you miss the first two? <a class="vt-p" href="http://go.voris.me/ur4c5" target="_blank">Here</a>'s the link: <a href="http://go.voris.me/ur4c5" target="_blank">http://go.voris.me/ur4c5</a>.</p>
<p>It finally (unofficially) happened!! Netflix Inc.'s hugely popular "Instant Streaming" service is now available on Netflix. I'd actually given up hope on this for a while. Sure, there's no "reason" that Netflix shouldn't run on Linux (*cough* Android, ChromeOS, Streaming Media Players, Moonlight, Aging Silverlight, etc. *cough*), but <a class="vt-p" href="http://go.voris.me/tz7p9" target="_blank">Netflix sure seemed to be certain</a> that they didn't want their streaming service available on Linux.</p>
<p>DRM is clearly not the issue (Android, Moonlight). Making it actually work on Linux is clearly not the issue (Android, ChromeOS). Netflix's only reason to continue denying Linux support is that&nbsp;<strong>they don't want to</strong> (or worse, they may be in cahoots with Microsoft, and neither have a vested interest in the adoption and spread of Linux).</p>
<p>I'm willing to bet that decision was the main impetus motivating the "hacker" world to get to work, doing what they do best: Fixing things! Once Netflix definitively said "no" to Linux support, the Community had to get involved. It's exactly this kind of&nbsp;<a class="vt-p" href="http://go.voris.me/a6ybj" target="_blank">playful cleverness</a>&nbsp;that makes the "hackers" so prone to succeed at what they do. They're not in it for the money, they're in it for the puzzles, the solution, and the community.</p>
<p>I have an older laptop (I call him Randall, and he runs Linux) that I have in mind of someday turning into a media server. I had all but given up on him serving Netflix up to my TV. I just didn't think it was in the cards. This bombshell turns the whole thing around, though! The possibilities are endless!</p>
<p>I'm most interested to see how this changes and shapes the industry, though. There's only one thing that Netflix can do now: <strong>embrace Linux</strong>! They'll have to either thank the people that made this work (after all, it's work that Netflix doesn't have to pay for), or come out with their own Netflix-Linux solution.</p>
<p>One thing is clear, though: they&nbsp;<em>can't</em> tow the line that they <em>won't</em> support Linux. Silverlight is aging, and will probably be EOL'd in the near future. Most people only know that it exists because they need to install it for Netflix to work. They don't think twice about it. I don't know what will take it's place, though.</p>
<p>Netflix has a job to make a best effort attempt to make sure the content they serve is right-protected. If they find that this solution doesn't provide that protection, they have another job to make sure that they stream their content with sufficient protection. Once something like this is "in the wild," it can't be undone. People will use this whether or not Netflix gives its blessing. Again, they're only choice is to embrace it or improve it.</p>
<p>What if they do? What if they do stick with their original story? Worse, what if they decide they're opposed to what's been done? I think they'll be facing a large backlash from the Open Source and/or Free Software communities. Sure, knowing that Netflix <em>could</em> run on Netflix but didn't was a pain. But, I wasn't going to give up my subscription. If they turn this into a fight, I sure might! And I'm sure the legions of the Internet would feel the same way. I might be a drop in the bucket, but the Community could have a large enough impact to really make a change.</p>

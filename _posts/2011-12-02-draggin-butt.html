<p>Have you ever had one of those days where you just felt like your feet were dragging, no matter what you were doing? I'm not talking about just a little tired, or just feeling a bit off here. Think about being completely exhausted. Think about being totally stretched past your limits. This was my day today.</p>
<p>I've had an unbelievably&nbsp;productive week at work. First, I've made some major headway on our <a class="vt-p" href="http://www.evergreen-ils.org/" target="_blank">Evergreen</a> project at the college. The server had been down for quite a while, now. I've been able to get the software up and running, and I've finally had a bit of luck importing some of our records into the database. Unfortunately, we're not out of the woods quite yet. This will prove to be a big project for me for a week or so to go, but I made some giant leaps forward on this project during the past few days.</p>
<p>Second, I was able to go live with the new online application for the Admissions team. We've made a couple of improvements to the application, added a few fields, and made it generally more user-friendly. If you're a potential college student, check it out, and <a class="vt-p" title="SLCC Application" href="https://www.slcconline.edu/admissions/apply/index.php" target="_blank">apply here</a>!</p>
<p>Finally, I'm working on a really nifty new service coming for the students of Saint Louis Christian College. A few weeks back, we introduced a piece of software called <a class="vt-p" href="http://www.papercut.com" target="_blank">PaperCut</a>. It's an all-encompassing Print Management program that allows the students to print to our new copy machine easier than they have in the past. This new feature that I'm working on will allow them to upload directly from their laptop (in .docx, .xlsx, .pptx, .xls, .pdf, etc. format) to the new copy machine. It'll print right from their laptop, but still charge their student accounts as if they were working on one of the library WorkStations. I'm really excited to roll this out, and I think the students will be, as well.</p>
<p>All of this really just piled up today. I was so dragging&nbsp;all day long. I felt like I was going to crash and fall asleep standing up in the Library.</p>
<p>Like I said, I feel like I had a greatly productive week! But I'm also ready to fall asleep tonight and wake up on&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunday!</p>

<p>Here's a really handy command that I tend to forget exists.</p>
<p>If you're running out of disk space, it can be really hard to track down a runaway file. Here's a way you can get some more information.</p>
<blockquote><p>du -hs /path/to/directory/or/file</p></blockquote>
<p>This helped me figure out once where my&nbsp;<strong>114GB</strong>&nbsp;log file was taking up all my space! Super handy!</p>

A while back, I was fortunate enough to participate in a panel discussion on
Third-Party voting, hosted by Dave Glover on [97.1 Talk Radio](https://971talk.radio.com)
in St. Louis.

I finally went and downloaded the file to put it up here. The panel is during
the first 15 minutes. Listen, if you want. Heads up: there may be a curse word
here and there.

<p>A while back, I was fortunate enough to participate in a panel discussion on Third-Party voting, hosted by Dave Glover on 97.1 Talk radio in St. Louis.</p>
<p>I finally went and downloaded the file to put it up here. Listen, if you want. Fair warning: there may be a curse word here and there.</p>

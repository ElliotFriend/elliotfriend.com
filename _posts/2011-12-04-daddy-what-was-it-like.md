If you're unfamiliar with who I am, or what's going on in my life, you may not
know that my beautiful wife, [Brandy Voris](http://brandy.voris.me), and I are
expecting a daughter. Whoa!! I'm just going to let that sink in for a minute...

I'm going to be a father. God, in all His infinite wisdom, saw fit to trust my
clumsy hands with the life and care of another real-life person ... Why?Â What
business do I have raising a daughter? What makes me even remotely ready to do
this? I know about computers and Jesus. How does that qualify me to be a dad?

I feel like it was just yesterday that I was sitting in the dorms at
[SLCC](http://www.slcconline.edu), acting like a total dill-hole (ya know, like
college kids do). Even still, I find myself looking back quite fondly on my
"college days." I was so free. I didn't have any responsibilities. I didn't have
to provide for anyone. I didn't have any bills. It was so sweet!

Yet, despite all my questions, despite all the fond memories of my former days,
despite feeling unprepared; I'm more excited than I've ever been in my life.
This is a completely new chapter for me. I've never experienced anything like
what I'm about to go through with this child. We get to learn together! I can't
wait for [Yo Gabba Gabba](http://www.yogabbagabba.com) marathons, walks in the
park with a stroller, wearing my daughter like a living front-backpack, and
kindergarten musicals!

One chapter ends on our journey of life, and another begins. All we can do is
look forward to the winding road, and give it everything we've got.

What was your reaction when you found out that you were going to be a parent?

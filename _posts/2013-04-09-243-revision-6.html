<p>A while back, I was fortunate enough to participate in a panel discussion on Third-Party voting, hosted by Dave Glover on 97.1 Talk radio in St. Louis.</p>
<p>I finally went and downloaded the file to put it up here. The panel is during the first 15 minutes. Listen, if you want. Head up: there may be a curse word here and there.</p>

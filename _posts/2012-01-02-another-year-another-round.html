<p>Each year, we pick our opponent. Each year, we pick the size, weight, strength, and reach of our heavyweight contender. Each year, we decide who we'll match up with in our title fight.</p>
<p>This year, I tried to make sure my opponent was simple, easy to understand.<br />
This year, I tried to make my opponent beneficial.<br />
This year, I tried to limit the opponents I would actually decide to take on.</p>
<p>Here are my opponents for this year, in no particular order:</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Write more consistently.</strong> I really like to write and put my thoughts down on paper (or on the internet). Ideally, I'd like to do this on a more regular basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Read my Bible daily.</strong> This is the discipline that continues to elude me. I feel like this will be the year that I finally get it down to a habit that I keep.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Read one book per month.</strong> I need to read. Not more, period. I really need to feed my brain with information. I think a book per month is a pretty good pace that I can achieve.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Exercise.</strong> Any amount is a vast improvement.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Dress like an adult now and then.</strong> Some days, I want to ditch the jeans and t-shirts that I'm so comfortable in. I want to get clothes that make me look like an adult, and then wear them once in a while. I'm a dad now, so why not dress like one?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Contribute to a community project regularly.</strong> I'm a big fan of the Open Source community. I'd like to contribute, financially or otherwise, to some community project frequently.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The key in my heavyweight bout: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">R</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">oll with the punches</span>! If I'm too dogmatic with any of these, I'm bound to fail. Flexibility will allow me to fail, get up, dust myself off, and try again.</span></p>

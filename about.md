I'm a follower of Jesus, a husband and father, preacher, teacher, technology
enthusiast, student, creator, and the list could go on and on.

I grew up in Phoenix, AZ. I moved to St. Louis to attend [https://stlchristian.edu]
(St. Louis Christian College) in 2007, and have called it home ever since.

I married **way up** in 2010, and have loved every minute of being with my awesome
wife, Brandy. We have three exceptionally amazing little ones: Journey Sophia (6),
Boston Elliot (4), and Lennux Renee (2).

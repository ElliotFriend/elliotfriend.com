I'm a follower of Jesus, a husband and father, preacher, teacher, technology
enthusiast, student, creator, and the list could go on and on.

I grew up in Phoenix, AZ. I moved to St. Louis to attend [St. Louis Christian
College](https://stlchristian.edu) in 2007, and have called it home ever since.

I married **way up** in 2010, and have loved every minute of being with my awesome
wife, Brandy. We have three exceptionally amazing little ones: Journey Sophia (6),
Boston Elliot (4), and Lennux Renee (2).

I currently call [Wildwood Christian Church](https://www.wccstl.org) home, and I
work there ast the Student Minister. I'm extremely lucky to have such a loving,
encouraging, and supportive church family!
